# InnovateCO-Data-Challenge

Due to environmental problems such as climate change, energy consumption has become a popular topic these years. No doubt that for sustainable development, we need to replace more fuel energy that can cause environmental problems with clean energy. However, development is not a single topic, the changes in usage of the energy should be connected with reality situations. So in this project, we are going to talk about the possibility that the Colorado state can balance the energy consumption and sustainability based on using renewable energy by analyze the data provided by the official websites. By the conclusion of the study of Colorado green energy status, the usage of renewable energy that has the greatest potential in Colorado is the solar energy. Based on the data of solar stations in Colorado state, we made a shiny map for the energy production and made the prediction for the solar energy
